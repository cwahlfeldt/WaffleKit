# WaffleKit

WaffleKit is a starter kit (boilerplate) from react with all the goodies of modern day web dev. I wanted something more customizable than what create-react-app gives you.

Uses webpack for all styles and development workflows.

`yarn` or `npm install` to fetch all dependencies.

`yarn start` to run webpack dev server - serves at `http://localhost:1337/`

`yarn build:dev` to build for development

`yarn build:prod` to build for production
